<h2>Overview</h2>
  <h3>Built with...</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML5</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What I learned</h3>
  Through completing this certification project, I have learned how to:<br><br>
  <ul>
    <li>use basic HTML to construct a website</li>
    <li>build a form using HTML</li>
    <li>how to use basic CSS to style a website</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Challenges</h3>
  While I completed all four beginning modules on freeCodeCamp in the lead up to building this site, I found that the CSS styling I added did not always displayed the way I expected it to from what I had learned. Additionally, I'd forgotten between doing the HTML form module and building the site some of the rules regarding radio/checkbox inputs, such as requiring a common name between options.<br><br>

  I think it might help to recheck the freeCodeCamp lessons and to use resources like MDN to reinforce my knowledge before moving onto the next set of modules.
  <h3>Useful resources</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>[Google Fonts] (https://fonts.google.com/): I used Google Fonts to find the font I used for this project, and used the embed links generated by the site to include it in the site.</li>
    <li>[Color Picker online] (https://imagecolorpicker.com/): I used this online color picker to pick colours for this site from the background image I used.</li>
  </ul>
